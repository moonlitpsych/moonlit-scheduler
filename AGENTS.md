# Agent instructions

## Project intro

This is the Moonlit Scheduling Platform!

## Rules
* When building a new feature, always build accompanying test(s) that test the
functionality of that feature.
* Never commit without first running all tests and making sure they pass.
* Run tests with `npm test`. Build tests that work with that command.
