## After Migration

Once the column is added, run this SQL to add Matthew Reese's alternate email:

```sql
-- Find Matthew Reese's patient ID
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM patients
WHERE first_name = 'Matthew' AND last_name = 'Reese';

-- Add alternate email (replace {patient_id} with actual ID from above)
UPDATE patients
SET alternate_emails = '["bwhipkey+16@firststephouse.org"]'::jsonb
WHERE id = '{patient_id}';

-- Verify it worked
SELECT first_name, last_name, email, alternate_emails
FROM patients
WHERE id = '{patient_id}';
```

## Then Test the Sync

Go to the partner dashboard and click the sync button for Matthew Reese. You should see in the console logs:
