/**
 * Migration 031: Add is_test_patient to Activity View
 * Created: 2025-10-28
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Add is_test_patient column to v_patient_activity_summary view
 * - Enable filtering test patients from admin patient rosters
 * - Depends on migration 030 (is_test_patient column on patients table)
 *
 * Note: This view is a regular VIEW (not materialized) for real-time data
