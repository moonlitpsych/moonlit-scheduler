# Patient Engagement Status System - Implementation Complete ✅

**Created:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Database Migration & Testing

## 🎯 Overview

Built a comprehensive patient engagement status tracking system that surfaces **factual scheduling data** without imposing clinical cadence requirements. The system provides clear visibility into patient activity while preserving staff control over engagement state.

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 019)

**File:** `/database-migrations/019-patient-engagement-status.sql`

**Tables Created:**
- `patient_engagement_status` - Global source of truth for patient engagement state
- `patient_engagement_status_history` - Complete audit trail of all status changes
- `v_patient_activity_summary` - Materialized view combining engagement status with appointment data

**Key Design Principles:**
- ✅ Time alone NEVER changes global status (manual changes only)
- ✅ Factual data: "last seen" and "next appointment" are derived, not prescribed
- ✅ Terminal states (discharged, transferred, deceased, inactive) require manual change
- ✅ Default state: "active" (patients remain active until explicitly changed)

### 2. API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/patients/activity-summary`
**Purpose:** Dashboard data with filtering and pagination

**Query Parameters:**
- `status` - Filter by engagement status
- `organization_id` - Filter by organization (for partner dashboard)
- `has_future_appointment` - Filter by appointment status (true/false)
- `no_appointment_since_days` - Filter patients not seen in X days
- `provider_id` - Filter by provider
- `sort_by` - Sort by last_seen | next_appointment | patient_name
- `limit` / `offset` - Pagination

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "patients": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 150,
    "limit": 100,
    "offset": 0,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

#### PUT `/api/patients/[id]/engagement-status`
**Purpose:** Update patient engagement status

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "status": "active" | "discharged" | "transferred" | "deceased" | "inactive",
  "effective_date": "2025-10-21T00:00:00Z",
  "change_reason": "Patient completed treatment program",
  "changed_by_email": "casemanager@example.com",
  "changed_by_type": "partner_user"
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Validates status values
- ✅ Requires reason for non-active status changes
- ✅ Auto-logs to history table via trigger
- ✅ Marks for admin notification when case manager changes to non-active
- ✅ Refreshes materialized view asynchronously

#### GET `/api/patients/[id]/status-history`
**Purpose:** Complete audit trail for a patient

**Returns:** Full history of status changes with who/when/why

### 3. UI Components

#### `EngagementStatusChip.tsx`
Visual chip showing patient engagement status with appropriate colors:
- 🟢 Active (green)
- 🔵 Discharged (blue)
- 🟣 Transferred (purple)
- ⚫ Deceased (gray)
- 🟡 Inactive (yellow)

#### `AppointmentStatusIndicator.tsx`
Shows whether patient has future appointment scheduled:
- ✅ Next appointment date + "in X days"
- ❌ "No future appointment"
- 📅 Last seen date (factual, not prescriptive)

#### `ChangeEngagementStatusModal.tsx`
Modal for case managers to update patient status:
- ✅ Radio button selection of status
- ✅ Effective date picker
- ✅ Required reason field for non-active changes
- ⚠️ Warning when admin will be notified
- ✅ Validation and error handling

### 4. Updated Partner Dashboard

**File:** `/src/app/partner-dashboard/patients/page.tsx`

**New Features:**
- 📊 Updated stats cards: Total, Active, No Future Appt, Assigned to Me
- 🔍 New filter chips: "Active Only", "No Future Appt"
- 📋 Reorganized table columns:
  - Patient (name + insurance)
  - Status (engagement status chip)
  - Last Seen / Next Appt (combined factual data)
  - Provider
  - Contact (email/phone)
  - Actions
- ⚙️ Modal integration for changing engagement status

## 🗂️ Core Data Model

### Engagement Status Values

| Status | Meaning | Who Can Set | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `active` | Default state | System/Staff | Patient is actively engaged in care |
| `discharged` | Completed treatment | Staff only | Patient successfully completed program |
| `transferred` | Moved to another provider | Staff only | Patient moved to different facility/provider |
| `inactive` | No longer seeking care | Staff only | Patient stopped engaging (not discharged) |
| `deceased` | Patient is deceased | Staff only | Patient has passed away |

### Materialized View Structure

`v_patient_activity_summary` combines:
- Patient demographics
- Current engagement status (from `patient_engagement_status`)
- Last seen date (most recent completed/kept appointment)
- Next appointment date (soonest future appointment, excluding cancelled/no-show)
- Has future appointment (boolean)
- Days since last seen / days until next appointment
- Organization affiliations (array of org IDs with ROI details)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to Supabase
supabase db execute --file database-migrations/019-patient-engagement-status.sql

# OR via psql
psql <connection-string> -f database-migrations/019-patient-engagement-status.sql
```

**What This Does:**
1. Creates `patient_engagement_status` table
2. Creates `patient_engagement_status_history` table
3. Creates triggers for auto-logging changes
4. Creates `v_patient_activity_summary` materialized view
5. Migrates all existing patients to "active" status
6. Refreshes materialized view
7. Grants permissions

**Expected Output:**
```
Migration 019: Patient Engagement Status System - COMPLETE
patients_with_status: <count>
view_patient_count: <count>
patients_with_future_appt: <count>
active_patients: <count>
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Use the debug endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/verify-patient-schema
```

### Step 3: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Get activity summary
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/patients/activity-summary?status=active&limit=10'

# Update engagement status (replace with real patient ID)
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:3000/api/patients/<patient-id>/engagement-status' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "status": "discharged",
    "change_reason": "Successfully completed treatment program",
    "changed_by_email": "admin@trymoonlit.com"
  }'

# Get status history
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/patients/<patient-id>/status-history'
```

### Step 4: Test UI

1. Navigate to Partner Dashboard → Patients
2. Verify new stats cards show correct counts
3. Test filter chips ("Active Only", "No Future Appt")
4. Verify table columns show engagement status and appointment indicators
5. Click patient row → Test "Change Status" action
6. Verify modal opens, allows status change, shows warning for admin notification

## 📊 Usage Patterns

### For Case Managers

**View Active Patients with No Future Appointment:**
1. Click "Active Only" filter chip
2. Click "No Future Appt" filter chip
3. Result: List of active patients needing scheduling help

**Change Patient Status:**
1. Find patient in roster
2. Click "Change Status" in Actions column
3. Select new status
4. Enter reason
5. Submit (admin will be notified if changing to non-active)

### For Providers

**View Their Panel:**
- Dashboard automatically shows assigned patients
- Sort by "Last Seen" to identify patients not seen recently
- Sort by "Next Appt" to see upcoming schedule
- Filter "No Future Appt" to identify patients who may need scheduling

### For Admin

**Monitor Status Changes:**
- Email notifications when case managers change patient to non-active status
- View audit trail via GET `/api/patients/[id]/status-history`
- Can toggle notifications on/off (future feature)

## 🔧 Maintenance Operations

### Refresh Materialized View

The view auto-refreshes after status changes, but you can manually refresh:

```sql
-- Via SQL
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY v_patient_activity_summary;

-- Via function
SELECT refresh_patient_activity_summary();
```

**When to Refresh:**
- After bulk appointment imports
- After PracticeQ syncs
- If data seems stale (though this should be automatic)

### View Performance Stats

```sql
SELECT
  engagement_status,
  COUNT(*) as patient_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE has_future_appointment = true) as with_future_appt,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE has_future_appointment = false) as without_future_appt,
  ROUND(AVG(days_since_last_seen), 1) as avg_days_since_seen
FROM v_patient_activity_summary
GROUP BY engagement_status;
```

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### What We Show (Factual)
- ✅ "Last seen: Oct 15, 2025"
- ✅ "Next appointment: Oct 28, 2025 (in 7 days)"
- ✅ "No future appointment"
- ✅ "Active", "Discharged", "Transferred", etc.

### What We DON'T Show (Prescriptive)
- ❌ "Overdue for appointment"
- ❌ "Needs attention"
- ❌ "Should be seen every X weeks"
- ❌ Auto-changing status based on time elapsed

### Why This Matters
- Avoids imposing clinical cadence requirements
- Gives staff complete control over patient status
- Surfaces objective data for staff to make their own decisions
- Respects that treatment timelines vary by patient

---

## 📝 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Admin Notifications (Not Yet Implemented)
- Email admin when case manager changes patient to non-active status
- Admin toggle to enable/disable notifications
- Notification batching (daily digest vs immediate)

### Phase 3: PracticeQ Sync Strategy
- Decide how to handle `practiceq_status` (active/archived)
- One-way sync (PracticeQ → Moonlit) or two-way?
- When to auto-update engagement status based on EHR data

### Phase 4: Reporting & Analytics
- Dashboard widgets showing trends over time
- Export patient lists by status
- Automated reports for case managers

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Materialized View Not Updating
```sql
-- Check last refresh time
SELECT schemaname, matviewname, last_refresh
FROM pg_matviews
WHERE matviewname = 'v_patient_activity_summary';

-- Force refresh
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY v_patient_activity_summary;
```

### Missing Patients in View
```sql
-- Check if patient has engagement status record
SELECT * FROM patient_engagement_status WHERE patient_id = '<patient-id>';

-- If missing, insert manually
INSERT INTO patient_engagement_status (patient_id, status, changed_by_email, change_reason)
VALUES ('<patient-id>', 'active', 'system@trymoonlit.com', 'Manual backfill');
```

### Performance Issues
The materialized view has indexes on:
- `patient_id` (unique)
- `engagement_status`
- `has_future_appointment`
- `last_seen_date`
- `next_appointment_date`
- `shared_with_org_ids` (GIN index for array searches)

If queries are slow, check indexes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'v_patient_activity_summary';
```
