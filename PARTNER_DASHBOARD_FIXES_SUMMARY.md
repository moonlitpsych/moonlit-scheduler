# Partner Dashboard Fixes Summary (Oct 16, 2025)

## ✅ All Requested Fixes Complete

### 1. Public Header Removed
**Problem:** Public website header was still showing after hard refresh.

**Root Cause:** The partner dashboard custom layout was nested within the root layout, which still rendered the public Header and Footer.

**Solution:** Created `ConditionalLayout` component that checks the pathname and conditionally renders public header/footer only for non-partner routes.

**Files:**
- **Created:** `src/components/layout/ConditionalLayout.tsx` - Conditional wrapper using `usePathname()`
- **Modified:** `src/app/layout.tsx` - Uses ConditionalLayout instead of direct Header/Footer

**Result:** ✅ Public header is now hidden on all `/partner-dashboard/*` and `/partner-auth/*` routes

---

### 2. Stat Cards Now Clickable
**Problem:** Clicking on stat cards didn't navigate anywhere.

**Solution:** Made all three stat cards clickable links that navigate to the Patients page.

**Files:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/partner-dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx`
  - Wrapped stat cards in `<Link>` components
  - All cards navigate to `/partner-dashboard/patients`
  - Added hover effect (shadow-lg on hover)

**Result:** ✅ All stat cards are now clickable and navigate to Patients page

---

### 3. Dead Links Removed
**Problem:** User dropdown menu had links to non-existent pages.

**Scan Results:**
- ❌ Profile & Settings (`/partner-dashboard/profile`) - DOESN'T EXIST
- ❌ Notifications (`/partner-dashboard/notifications`) - DOESN'T EXIST
- ❌ Organization Settings (`/partner-dashboard/organization`) - DOESN'T EXIST
- ❌ View Details link on patients page - DOESN'T EXIST
- ✅ Calendar page (`/partner-dashboard/calendar`) - EXISTS AND WORKS

**Solution:** Removed all dead links from the UI.

**Files:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/partner-dashboard/PartnerHeader.tsx`
  - Removed "Profile & Settings" menu item
  - Removed "Notifications" menu item
  - Removed "Organization Settings" menu item (admin-only)
  - User dropdown now shows only "Sign out"

- **Modified:** `src/app/partner-dashboard/patients/page.tsx`
  - Removed "View Details" link for each patient
  - Actions column now shows only: Transfer (if assigned) | Notify

**Result:** ✅ All dead links removed - clean user experience with no broken navigation
