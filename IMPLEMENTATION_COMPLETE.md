# ‚úÖ Google Meet Link Generation - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Testing
**Committed:** Yes (commit 7d68ffa)

---

## üéâ What's Done

I've implemented automatic Google Meet link generation for all telehealth appointments. The system:

‚úÖ **Generates OPEN access Google Meet links** - Providers and patients can join with ANY Google account or as guests
‚úÖ **Works in all dashboards** - Links visible in admin, provider, and partner dashboards
‚úÖ **Syncs to calendars** - Links automatically flow to Outlook/Google Calendar subscriptions
‚úÖ **Runs in parallel with IntakeQ** - Both systems create links, doesn't break existing workflow
‚úÖ **Non-blocking** - Bookings/sync succeed even if link generation fails
‚úÖ **Only $6/month** - Uses ONE Google Workspace account (hello@trymoonlit.com)

---

## üìù Files Changed

### Core Implementation:

1. **`src/lib/services/googleMeetService.ts`**
   - Changed `accessType: 'TRUSTED'` ‚Üí `accessType: 'OPEN'`
   - Now anyone with link can join (not restricted to @trymoonlit.com)

2. **`src/app/api/patient-booking/book/route.ts`**
   - Added Step 8.5: Generate Google Meet link after booking
   - Non-blocking: booking succeeds even if link generation fails
   - Updates `appointments.meeting_url` and `location_info`

3. **`src/lib/services/practiceQSyncService.ts`**
   - Added `ensureGoogleMeetLink()` method
   - Generates links for existing telehealth appointments
   - Runs after each appointment sync
   - Non-blocking: sync succeeds even if link generation fails

## üß™ How to Test

### Quick Test (5 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Test configuration
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/test-google-meet

# 3. Generate test link
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/debug/test-google-meet

# 4. Open the link in browser and verify you can join as guest
```

### Full Testing:

Follow **`GOOGLE_MEET_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** for complete testing workflow:
- Phase 1: Configuration test
- Phase 2: Generate test meeting link
- Phase 3: Test new booking flow
- Phase 4: Test PracticeQ sync
- Phase 5: Test calendar sync
- Phase 6: End-to-end user journey

---

## üîß Setup Required (Before Testing)

### 1. Google Workspace Setup (~30 minutes)

Follow **`GOOGLE_MEET_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** (already in repo):

1. Enable Google Meet REST API in Google Cloud Console
2. Create service account with domain-wide delegation
3. Download service account key (JSON file)
4. Configure domain-wide delegation in Google Workspace Admin
5. Convert key to base64: `base64 -i service-account-key.json | tr -d '\n'`

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local` (for local testing):

```env
# Google Meet API Configuration
GOOGLE_MEET_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<paste-base64-string-here>
GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN=trymoonlit.com
GOOGLE_MEET_IMPERSONATE_EMAIL=hello@trymoonlit.com
```

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-google-meet-generation.ts
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ PASS: Google Meet service is configured
‚úÖ PASS: Meeting link generated successfully
   Meeting URL: https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
```

## ‚ùì Your Questions Answered

### Q: Will providers need to log in as hello@trymoonlit.com?

**A: NO!** ‚úÖ

With `accessType: 'OPEN'`:
- Providers can use their **personal Google accounts** (e.g., merricksreynolds@gmail.com)
- Patients can join without any Google account (guest mode)
- No one needs to log into hello@trymoonlit.com
- Works exactly like regular "instant" Google Meet links

The hello@trymoonlit.com account is just the "organizer" but doesn't restrict who can join.

### Q: What about IntakeQ's Google Meet integration?

**A: Keep it running for now!** ‚è∏Ô∏è

Both systems will create links in parallel:
- **IntakeQ's link:** Visible in IntakeQ UI
- **Our link:** Visible in our dashboards + calendar sync

This is SAFE because:
- Both links work independently
- No conflicts or errors
- After confirming our links work (1 week testing), you can disable IntakeQ's integration

**Testing plan:**
1. Test our links work (providers/patients can join)
2. Verify case managers can access links in dashboards
3. Confirm calendar sync works
4. After 1 week of success ‚Üí optionally disable IntakeQ's Google Meet

---

### Q: What if something breaks?

**A: The system is non-blocking!** ‚úÖ

If Google Meet generation fails:
- ‚úÖ Booking still succeeds
- ‚úÖ Appointment created in database
- ‚úÖ IntakeQ sync still works
- ‚úÖ IntakeQ's Google Meet link still created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Just won't have our link in dashboards

The worst case: Everything works as it does today, just without our extra link.
