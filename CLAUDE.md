## 📋 FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

### **When to Use This System**
This professional healthcare website + booking system is **production-ready** for healthcare providers who:
- Want a complete professional website with integrated booking
- Need double-booking prevention
- Use IntakeQ EMR system
- Want professional patient booking experience
- Need real-time availability management
- Require detailed admin notifications
- Want brand-consistent design with testimonials and provider directories

### **New Assets & Design System**
**Brand Assets** (in `public/images/`):
- `MOONLIT-LOGO-WITH-TITLE.png` - Professional logo with text
- `text-stroke-of-color.png` - Color stroke background for hero text
- `moonlit-footer-background.png` - Footer background pattern
- `utah-icon.png` & `Idaho-icon.png` - State outline icons
- Patient testimonial images: `my-notion-face-transparent-*.png`

**Design System**:
- **Typography**: Newsreader font family with light font weights
- **Colors**: Navy (#091747), Earth brown (#BF9C73), Cream (#FEF8F1), Orange accent (#E67A47)
- **Components**: Professional Header, Footer, Provider cards with consistent styling
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with elegant desktop enhancements

### **Development Environment Setup**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Set up environment variables (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
INTAKEQ_API_KEY=your_intakeq_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key  # Optional - will log to console without it

# 3. Run development server
npm run dev

# 4. Test at http://localhost:3000
```

### **Development Workflow (IMPORTANT)**

**🚨 ALWAYS TEST LOCALLY BEFORE PUSHING TO PRODUCTION**

```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
# 2. Test thoroughly at http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3001
# 3. Iterate rapidly with user feedback
# 4. Only commit/push when features are confirmed working
# 5. Production deploys automatically from main branch

# For UI/UX changes especially:
# - Test booking flow end-to-end
# - Test on mobile and desktop
# - Verify all interactive elements work
# - Check console for errors
```

**Rationale:** Local testing allows rapid iteration and prevents production issues. The production system at `booking.trymoonlit.com` auto-deploys from main branch, so only push confirmed working changes.

### **Common Tasks**

#### Adding New EMR Systems
1. Create new service in `src/lib/services/yourEMRService.ts`
2. Add EMR type to database configuration
3. Update `create-appointment/route.ts` to handle new EMR
4. Add conflict checking for new EMR in `merged-availability/route.ts`

#### Customizing Email Templates
Edit `src/lib/services/emailService.ts`:
- `sendAdminNotification()` for admin emails
- `sendFallbackPatientNotification()` for patient emails
- Add new notification types as needed

#### Modifying Booking Flow
Edit `src/components/booking/BookingFlow.tsx`:
- Add new steps to `BookingStep` type
- Create new view components in `src/components/booking/views/`
- Update step progression in handlers

### **Monitoring and Maintenance**

#### **Key Logs to Monitor**
```bash
# Booking success/failure rates
grep "✅ Appointment created successfully" logs

# Double-booking prevention effectiveness  
grep "409" logs | grep "Time slot no longer available"

# IntakeQ API health
grep "IntakeQ" logs | grep "❌"

# Email notification status
grep "📧" logs
```

#### **Database Health Checks**
```sql
-- Check appointment creation rate
SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*) 
FROM appointments 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days' 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Verify provider availability data
SELECT provider_id, COUNT(*) as availability_records
FROM provider_availability_cache 
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE 
GROUP BY provider_id;
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### "Buttons on welcome page are not clickable"
This is a React/Next.js build cache issue that occurs occasionally:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop the development server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next && rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm run dev
```

**Root causes:**
- Webpack build cache corruption
- TypeScript compilation errors from imports
- Missing Next.js routes manifest

**Prevention:**
- Always test the welcome page buttons after making component changes
- If buttons become unclickable, clear build cache immediately
- Check browser console for React hydration errors

#### "No availability showing"
1. Check Supabase connection in browser dev tools
2. Verify `provider_availability_cache` has data for requested dates
3. Check `provider_payers` table for insurance relationships
4. Review console logs for API errors

#### "Double-booking occurred"
1. Check IntakeQ API key validity
2. Verify `intakeq_practitioner_id` mapping in providers table
3. Review conflict checking logs in merged-availability endpoint
4. Ensure proper timezone handling in date comparisons

#### "Appointments not creating in IntakeQ"
1. Verify IntakeQ API credentials
2. Check service/location IDs are valid for your IntakeQ account
3. Review IntakeQ rate limiting (10/min, 500/day)
4. Check appointment payload matches IntakeQ API requirements

#### "Email notifications not sending"
1. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set (optional - will log to console without it)
2. Check FROM_EMAIL environment variable
3. Review Resend dashboard for delivery status
4. Emails are logged to console as fallback

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **API Response Times**: Typically < 2 seconds for availability
- **Booking Success Rate**: Should be > 95%
- **IntakeQ Integration**: < 5 seconds for appointment creation
- **Conflict Detection**: Real-time, typically < 1 second

## 📞 SUPPORT INFORMATION

### **System Health Dashboard**
Monitor at: http://localhost:3000/api/health (if implemented)

### **Key Metrics to Track**
- Daily booking volume
- Double-booking prevention effectiveness (409 responses)
- IntakeQ integration success rate
- Email notification delivery rate
- User experience completion rate (welcome → confirmation)

### **Emergency Contacts**
- **Database Issues**: Check Supabase dashboard
- **IntakeQ Issues**: Check IntakeQ API status
- **Email Issues**: Check Resend dashboard

## 🗺️ UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE PLAN (NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE)

### **🎯 THREE USER JOURNEYS**

#### **🏥 Patient Journey (Primary)**
```
Homepage (/) → Browse Services → Book Appointment (/book/*) → Confirmation
├── /providers (Provider directory with filtering)
├── /insurance (Insurance information)  
└── /about (Services and company information)
```

#### **👩‍⚕️ Provider Journey (Secondary)**
```
Homepage (/) → Login/Signup (/auth/*) → Dashboard (/dashboard/*)
├── /dashboard/availability (Schedule management) ✅ COMPLETE
├── /dashboard/appointments (View upcoming appointments) 🔄 READY TO BUILD
├── /dashboard/visits (Google Meet integration) 🔄 READY TO BUILD  
├── /dashboard/notes (AI note generation) 🔄 INTEGRATION PENDING
├── /dashboard/profile (Profile management)
└── /dashboard/settings (Preferences)
```

#### **🔧 Admin Journey (Tertiary)**  
```
Staff Login (/staff-login) → Admin Dashboard (/admin/*)
├── /admin/providers (Provider management)
├── /admin/appointments (System oversight)
├── /admin/analytics (System metrics)
└── /admin/settings (System configuration)
```

### **🧭 NAVIGATION STRATEGY**

#### **Smart Contextual Headers**
- **Anonymous Users**: `[LOGO] Home | Providers | Insurance | Book Now | Provider Login`
- **Authenticated Providers**: `[LOGO] Dashboard | Appointments | Availability | Notes | Visits | [Profile ↓]`
- **Patients (Booking)**: `[LOGO] ← Back | Progress (Step X of 7) | Help`
- **Admins**: `[LOGO] Dashboard | Providers | System | Analytics | [Admin ↓]`

#### **Role-Based Routing**
```javascript
// Middleware logic for next developer
if (user?.role === 'provider') defaultRoute = '/dashboard/availability'
else if (user?.role === 'admin') defaultRoute = '/admin/dashboard'  
else defaultRoute = '/' // Anonymous or patient
```

### **📱 RECOMMENDED FILE STRUCTURE**
