üéâ CLAUDE CODE: Moonlit Scheduler
üö® Critical Development Policy

No mock data without explicit permission.

Never insert fake IntakeQ IDs, providers, or placeholder database rows.

Data integrity is critical ‚Äî this is a healthcare application.

‚ö†Ô∏è **ALWAYS VERIFY BEFORE MODIFYING DATABASE SCHEMA**

Before adding columns or modifying tables:
1. Create debug API endpoints to verify column existence
2. Use multiple verification methods (direct SELECT, SELECT *, UPDATE attempt)
3. Check related tables for similar columns
4. Document findings in a verification report
5. Get explicit user confirmation before proceeding

**Example verification endpoints:**
- `/api/debug/check-[table]-columns` - Direct column checks
- `/api/debug/search-all-tables-for-columns` - Cross-table searches
- `/api/debug/final-column-verification` - Multi-method verification

This prevents duplicate columns, schema conflicts, and maintains data integrity.

## üö® PENDING TASK: IntakeQ Service/Location ID Integration (Oct 4, 2025)

**STATUS:** Database migration ready, awaiting execution

**WHAT'S NEEDED:** Two columns must be added to `providers` table:
- `intakeq_service_id` (TEXT)
- `intakeq_location_id` (TEXT)

**VERIFICATION COMPLETED:** Columns confirmed NOT to exist (see `COLUMN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`)

**ACTION FOR NEXT CLAUDE CODE:**
1. Run migration: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/migrate-intakeq-fields`
2. Verify: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/update-provider-intakeq-ids`
3. Wait for user to provide IntakeQ Service/Location IDs from their dashboard
4. Update providers as user provides IDs

**FILES READY:**
- Migration SQL: `/database-migrations/002-add-intakeq-service-location-ids.sql`
- Setup guide: `INTAKEQ_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Handoff doc: `HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_CLAUDE.md`

**WHY:** Appointments currently save to Supabase but don't sync to IntakeQ (missing IDs)

üåü Project Status

Moonlit Scheduler = production-ready healthcare website + booking platform

Fully functional booking system (dual intent: Book Now vs See Availability).

Provider directory with real data and filtering.

Double-booking prevention + IntakeQ EMR integration.

Provider auth with admin/provider dual roles.

RLS-compliant schedule management API.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind
Backend: Next.js API routes + Supabase Postgres
Auth: Supabase Auth (admin vs provider vs partner separation)
EHRs: IntakeQ + Athena integrations
Email: Resend API (logs to console if unset)

‚úÖ Current Functionality

Website routes:

/ homepage

/book booking flow (?intent=book|explore)

/practitioners searchable provider directory

/ways-to-pay insurance directory

Booking flow: Welcome ‚Üí Insurance ‚Üí Calendar ‚Üí ROI ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Confirmation

APIs: availability, create appointment, providers-for-payer, ways-to-pay.

Features: real-time conflict checking, language selection, clinical supervision model, exception handling, dual-role login, partner authentication.

Status: All tested and working in production (as of Sept 12, 2025).

üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Provider/Auth Rules

Dual-role support: e.g. Dr. C. Rufus Sweeney can switch between admin and provider dashboards.

Provider visibility: controlled by list_on_provider_page + is_bookable.

Supervision model: Residents bookable if supervised by attending (billing) provider.

RLS compliance: All provider schedule reads/writes go through admin-privileged API endpoints.

üîß Development Setup
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Env vars (.env.local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
INTAKEQ_API_KEY=...
RESEND_API_KEY=...

# Run locally
npm run dev


Always test locally before pushing (main auto-deploys).

Verify booking flow end-to-end on desktop + mobile.

üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks

Add EMR: create src/lib/services/[emr]Service.ts, update booking routes.

Emails: edit src/lib/services/emailService.ts.

Booking flow: modify src/components/booking/BookingFlow.tsx.

Admin/provider auth: see auth_profiles + app_users tables.

üîç Troubleshooting

Welcome page buttons unclickable ‚Üí clear .next + node_modules/.cache.

No availability ‚Üí check provider_availability_cache, providers, payers.

Double-booking ‚Üí validate IntakeQ IDs + conflict logic.

Appointments missing in IntakeQ ‚Üí confirm API key + practitioner mapping.

Email not sending ‚Üí check RESEND_API_KEY, otherwise see console logs.

**üö® RECURRING BUG: startDateTime Validation Errors - PERMANENTLY FIXED**

**Symptoms**: Console errors like `Invalid startDateTime: "09:00" "from slot:" {}`

**Root Cause**: The validateAndNormalizeData function in mapApiSlotToTimeSlot expected arrays but received individual objects, causing data corruption that resulted in empty objects `{}` being passed to fallback functions.

**Why it kept recurring**: Previous Claude instances tried to fix validation schemas instead of removing the problematic validation layer entirely.

**PERMANENT SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
- Removed validateAndNormalizeData from mapApiSlotToTimeSlot in dataValidation.ts:160
- Implemented direct field mapping that handles the actual API response format
- Added clear documentation explaining why validation was removed
- This approach eliminates the data corruption that caused the errors

**NEVER**: Re-add validation to mapApiSlotToTimeSlot - it causes more problems than it solves

üìä Monitoring

Audit API logs for 409 conflicts (double-booking prevention).

Track appointment creation rate in appointments table.

Use debug endpoints (/api/debug/...) for provider-payer relationships, availability, and bookability explanations.

üìù For Future Developers

Use canonical view v_bookable_provider_payer for provider-payer relationships.

Avoid direct Supabase client calls from frontend for protected tables ‚Üí always use API endpoints.

Keep role separation clear: admin, provider, partner each have distinct routes and dashboards.

All production data must be real; confirm with Miriam before seeding.
