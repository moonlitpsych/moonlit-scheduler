# Email to Regence Provider Services - Product Acceptance Confirmation

## Version 1: Concise (Recommended)

**To:** Regence Provider Services
**Subject:** Confirmation of Accepted Insurance Products - Moonlit (TIN: 332185708)

---

Hello,

I'm reaching out on behalf of **Moonlit** (TIN: 332185708) regarding our provider contract with Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Utah, effective November 1, 2025.

We're updating our online booking system to verify patient insurance eligibility at the plan level (not just payer level). To ensure accurate eligibility verification, we need to confirm **which specific Regence insurance products our contract accepts**.

**Our Question:**
Does our contract accept all Regence individual and family insurance products, or are there specific products/networks excluded?

**Context:**
We've identified the following Regence products available in Utah for 2025:

**Individual & Family Network (IAFN):**
- Bronze Essential 8500
- Regence Standard Bronze 7500
- Bronze HSA 7000
- Regence Standard Silver 5000
- Silver 6200
- Silver 5000
- Gold 2300
- Regence Standard Gold 1500

**SaveWell Network:**
- SaveWell Standard Bronze 7500
- SaveWell Standard Silver 5000
- SaveWell Standard Gold 1500

Our contract indicates participation in both the "Individual and Family Network" and "SaveWell" networks. Does this mean we accept patients enrolled in **all** of the products listed above?

If there are any product exclusions, limitations, or specific requirements we should be aware of, please let us know.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

## Version 2: Detailed (If You Need More Context)

**To:** Regence Provider Services
**Subject:** Plan-Level Eligibility Verification - Moonlit (TIN: 332185708)

---

Hello,

I'm writing on behalf of **Moonlit**, a mental health practice in Salt Lake City (TIN: 332185708). We have a provider contract with Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Utah effective November 1, 2025.

**Purpose:**
We're implementing plan-level insurance verification in our online patient booking system to improve accuracy and reduce claim denials. Currently, we can only verify at the payer level (e.g., "accepts Regence"), but we'd like to verify at the product level (e.g., "accepts Regence Silver 6200").

**What We Need:**
Confirmation of which specific Regence insurance products (plan names) our contract accepts for individual and family members.

**What We Know:**
Our contract's Provider Network Addendum (pages 28-29) lists participation in multiple networks, including:
- Individual and Family Network
- SaveWell
- FocalPoint
- Preferred ValueCare
- [and several others]

However, we understand these are **provider network tiers** (claims routing), not patient insurance products.

**What We're Asking:**
Based on Regence's 2025 Individual & Family plan brochure, Utah members may have one of these insurance products:

**Individual & Family Network (IAFN) Products:**
1. Bronze Essential 8500 (Essential tier with Virtual Primary Care)
2. Regence Standard Bronze 7500 (Marketplace only)
3. Bronze HSA 7000 (HSA-qualified)
4. Regence Standard Silver 5000 (Marketplace only)
5. Silver 6200 (with Individual Assistance Program)
6. Silver 5000 (with Individual Assistance Program)
7. Gold 2300 (with Individual Assistance Program)
8. Regence Standard Gold 1500 (Marketplace only)

**SaveWell Network Products:**
9. SaveWell Standard Bronze 7500
10. SaveWell Standard Silver 5000
11. SaveWell Standard Gold 1500

**Our Questions:**

1. **Does our contract accept all 11 products listed above?**
   - If no, which products are excluded?

2. **Do network participation and product acceptance align?**
   - Example: Since we participate in "SaveWell" network, does that automatically mean we accept all SaveWell products (Bronze/Silver/Gold)?

3. **Are there any product-level exclusions or limitations we should know about?**
   - Example: Accept only ACA Marketplace plans vs. direct enrollment plans
   - Example: Accept only certain metal tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold)

4. **How should we handle Marketplace-only products?**
   - Do "Regence Standard Bronze 7500" (Marketplace only) and "Bronze Essential 8500" (Direct enrollment) have different acceptance criteria?

**Why This Matters:**
When a patient books online and enters "Regence Silver 6200," we want to accurately display:
- ✅ "We accept your plan - you can book an appointment"
- ❌ "Your plan is not accepted with this provider"

**Additional Info:**
- Moonlit Location: Salt Lake City, UT 84105
- Service Type: Mental health (outpatient psychiatry)
- Patient Population: Individual and family members (commercial insurance)

Please let us know if you need any additional information from our contract or practice details.

Thank you for your time and assistance.
