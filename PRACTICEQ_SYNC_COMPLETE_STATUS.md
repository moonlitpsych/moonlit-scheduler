## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### **Step 1: Run Database Migrations**

```bash
# Migration 022: Sync logs table
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: database-migrations/022-create-sync-logs-table.sql

# Migration 023: Meeting URLs and location info
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: database-migrations/023-add-meeting-url-location.sql
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check sync_logs table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sync_logs;

-- Check appointments have new columns
SELECT COUNT(*) as appointments_with_meeting_url
FROM appointments
WHERE meeting_url IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables**

**In Vercel:**
```bash
CRON_SECRET=<generate with: openssl rand -base64 32>
```

**In local .env.local:**
```bash
CRON_SECRET=<same as above>
```

---

### **Step 3: Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/practiceq-sync-improvements

# Merge to main or deploy preview
# Vercel will automatically:
# - Detect vercel.json
# - Schedule cron job
# - Deploy new endpoints
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Cron Job**

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to: Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs
2. Verify: `0 9 * * *` (3am MT) ‚Üí `/api/cron/sync-practiceq-appointments`
3. Status should show: **Active**

---

### **Step 5: Run Initial Bulk Sync**

1. Login as partner user (First Step House)
2. Navigate to /partner-dashboard/patients
3. Click "Refresh All Appointments" button
4. Wait for completion (30-60 seconds)
5. Verify appointment data populates with:
   - Meeting URLs (if telehealth)
   - Location names (if in-person)

---

### **Step 6: Verify Meeting URLs Display**

**Expected Results:**

**For Telehealth Appointments:**
```
[Video Icon] Join Video Call [Copy Icon]
```
- Clicking link opens Google Meet in new tab
- Clicking copy puts URL on clipboard

**For In-Person Appointments:**
```
[Map Pin Icon] Insurance ‚Äî UT (or location name)
```

**For Missing Data:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Location details not available. Contact provider's office.
```

---

## üìà Expected Behavior

### **Daily Automated Sync (3am MT)**

**What Happens:**
1. Cron triggers at 3:00 AM Mountain Time
2. Fetches all active organizations
3. For each org, gets all active patients
4. Syncs last 90 days + next 90 days
5. Creates entry in `sync_logs` table
6. Logs: patients processed, appointments (new/updated/unchanged), errors
7. Case managers wake up to fresh data

**Monitoring Query:**
```sql
SELECT
  started_at,
  status,
  patients_processed,
  appointments_new,
  appointments_updated,
  appointments_unchanged,
  appointments_errors,
  duration_ms / 1000 as duration_seconds
FROM sync_logs
WHERE sync_type = 'automated_daily'
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

---

### **Bulk Refresh Button (On-Demand)**

**What Happens:**
1. Case manager clicks "Refresh All Appointments"
2. Modal opens showing progress
3. System syncs all organization patients (~12 for FSH)
4. Takes 30-60 seconds
5. Shows success summary: "X new, Y updated, Z unchanged"
6. Patient roster auto-refreshes with latest data

---

### **Meeting URL Display**

**What Happens:**
1. Daily sync extracts `TelehealthInfo.Url` from IntakeQ
2. Stores in `appointments.meeting_url`
3. Partner dashboard displays:
   - **If telehealth:** Blue "Join Video Call" button + Copy link
   - **If in-person:** Gray location name with map pin icon
4. Case manager can:
   - Click link ‚Üí Opens meeting
   - Click copy ‚Üí Share with patient via SMS/email

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Meeting URLs Not Showing**

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if TelehealthInfo is being populated
SELECT
  id,
  start_time,
  meeting_url,
  location_info
FROM appointments
WHERE pq_appointment_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. IntakeQ doesn't provide TelehealthInfo for all appointments
2. Only telehealth appointments have meeting URLs
3. Need to re-sync to populate existing appointments

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run bulk sync to re-fetch appointment data
# Click "Refresh All Appointments" in partner dashboard
```

---

### **Issue: Cron Job Not Running**

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Vercel Cron Jobs dashboard
2. Check deployment logs: `vercel logs`
3. Verify CRON_SECRET is set

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-deploy to register cron job
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger cron registration"
git push origin main
```

---

### **Issue: Copy Button Not Working**

**Diagnosis:**
- Browser clipboard API requires HTTPS
- Works in production, may fail on localhost

**Fix:**
- Test on deployed preview/production environment
- Use browser DevTools to check for clipboard permissions

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### **After First Week:**

**Automated Sync:**
- ‚úÖ 7 successful daily syncs in `sync_logs`
- ‚úÖ 90%+ completion rate (patients_processed / totalPatients)

- ‚úÖ Duration: 15-30 seconds per sync

**Meeting URLs:**
- ‚úÖ 50%+ of appointments have `meeting_url` populated
