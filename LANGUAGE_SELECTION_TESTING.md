# Language Selection Feature Testing Guide

## üéØ Feature Overview

The language selection feature allows patients to:
1. Select from available languages that providers speak
2. Request custom languages not in the dropdown 
3. Automatically trigger email notifications for manual review of custom language requests
4. Filter providers based on language capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### API Endpoints
- **`GET /api/patient-booking/available-languages`** - Returns list of all languages spoken by active providers
- **`POST /api/patient-booking/request-custom-language`** - Sends email notification for custom language requests
- **`POST /api/patient-booking/merged-availability`** - Filters availability by language (updated)
- **`POST /api/admin/cleanup-sample-languages`** - Admin utility to clean up test language data

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `providers.languages_spoken: string[]` field
- Queries active, bookable providers only
- Supports both array and JSON string formats for language data

### Email Notification System
- Integrates with existing `emailService` 
- Uses `sendAdminNotification()` with fallback to console logging
- Sends to `hello@trymoonlit.com` with complete appointment request details

## ‚úÖ Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Language Dropdown Population

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to booking flow: `/book`
2. Select any insurance provider
3. Check "My appointment should be held in a language other than English"
4. Verify dropdown shows available languages

**Expected Results:**
- Dropdown populated with: English, French, German, Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish
- English appears first in the list
- All languages come from active provider data

**API Call to Verify:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patient-booking/available-languages
```

**Expected Response (after real data is added):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish", "..."], // Based on real provider language data
  "total_providers": N
}
```

**Current Response (sample data cleaned):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "languages": [],
  "total_providers": 0
}
```

### 2. Provider Filtering by Language

**Test Steps:**
1. Start booking flow with any insurance
2. Enable language selection and choose "Spanish"
3. Switch to "By Availability" view
4. Verify only Spanish-speaking providers appear

**Expected Results:**
- Only Travis Norseth and Rufus Sweeney should appear (per sample data)
- Appointment slots should only come from these providers
- Calendar should show "2 providers available" for Spanish slots

**Database Verification:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, languages_spoken 
FROM providers 
WHERE languages_spoken @> '["Spanish"]' 
AND is_active = true;
```

### 3. Custom Language Request Flow

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to calendar view in booking flow
2. Enable language selection
3. Select "Other (not listed here)" from dropdown
4. Enter "Italian" in the custom language field
5. Verify "Pending Review" message appears
6. Select any available time slot
7. Check server logs/email for notification

**Expected Results:**
- Yellow "Pending Review" banner appears with custom language name
- On slot selection, API call made to `/api/patient-booking/request-custom-language`
- Email sent to hello@trymoonlit.com (or logged to console)
- Console shows: "‚úÖ Custom language request sent successfully"

**API Call Verification:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/patient-booking/request-custom-language \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customLanguage": "Italian",
    "patientInfo": {
      "firstName": "Test",
      "lastName": "Patient"
    },
    "selectedPayer": {
      "id": "test-payer",
      "name": "Test Insurance"
    },
    "appointmentDetails": {
      "preferredDate": "2025-09-05",
      "preferredTime": "10:00 AM"
    }
  }'
```

### 4. Email Content Verification

**Expected Email Content:**
```
Subject: Custom Language Request: Italian

New Custom Language Appointment Request

REQUESTED LANGUAGE: Italian

PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Name: Test Patient
- Email: Not provided
- Phone: Not provided

INSURANCE INFORMATION:
- Insurance: Test Insurance
- Payer ID: test-payer

APPOINTMENT PREFERENCES:
- Requested Date: 2025-09-05
- Preferred Time: 10:00 AM
- Additional Notes: Language request: Italian

NEXT STEPS:
1. Contact the patient to discuss language accommodation options
2. Identify providers who can conduct appointments in Italian
3. Schedule appointment manually if accommodation is possible
4. Follow up within 24-48 hours

This request was generated automatically from the booking system.
```

### 5. Language Selection State Management

**Test Steps:**
1. Select "Spanish" from language dropdown
2. Verify provider filtering occurs immediately
3. Change to "French" 
4. Verify providers update to French speakers only
5. Change back to "English"
6. Verify all providers reappear

**Expected Results:**
- Spanish: Shows Travis Norseth, Rufus Sweeney
- French: Shows Merrick Reynolds
- English: Shows all 6 providers
- German: Shows Anthony Privratsky
- Portuguese: Shows Tatiana Kaehler

### 6. Provider Availability Integration

**Test Steps:**
1. Select "Portuguese" language
2. Verify only Tatiana Kaehler appears in provider list
3. Select a date and verify availability slots
4. Switch to "English" and verify all providers return

**Expected Results:**
- Portuguese filtering works correctly
- API calls include `language: "Portuguese"` parameter
- Only Tatiana's availability appears
- Console logs show language filtering activity

### 7. UI/UX Validation

**Test Steps:**
1. Verify checkbox label: "My appointment should be held in a language other than English"
2. Check dropdown label: "What language should this appointment be held in?"
3. Verify custom language input placeholder: "Please specify the language"
4. Test "Pending Review" message styling and content
5. Verify language selection integrates with insurance selection bar

**Expected Results:**
- All UI text matches design requirements
- Styling uses Moonlit brand colors (#BF9C73, #091747)
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Language selection appears in insurance confirmation bar

## üêõ Error Scenarios

### 1. No Language Data Available

**Simulate:** Remove all language data from providers
**Expected:** Empty dropdown with just "English" and "Other" options
**Recovery:** System should gracefully handle empty language arrays

### 2. API Connection Failure

**Simulate:** Disconnect from database during language fetch
**Expected:** "Loading languages..." shows indefinitely or shows error
**Recovery:** User can still select "Other" and proceed with custom language

### 3. Email Service Failure

**Simulate:** Invalid email API keys
**Expected:** Custom language request fails but logs to console
**Recovery:** Request details preserved in server logs for manual follow-up

### 4. Invalid Language Characters

**Test:** Enter special characters or very long language names
**Expected:** System handles gracefully, sanitizes input
**Recovery:** Email content should be safe and properly formatted

## üìä Performance Testing

### Response Time Benchmarks
- Language list API: < 500ms
- Provider filtering: < 1000ms
- Custom language email: < 2000ms
- Language change + provider refresh: < 1500ms

### Load Testing
- Test 100 concurrent language dropdown requests
- Verify database connection handling
- Test email queue under high custom language volume

## üîç Debugging Tools

### Console Commands
```javascript
// Check current language state in browser console
console.log('Selected Language:', selectedLanguage)
console.log('Custom Language:', customLanguage)
console.log('Available Languages:', availableLanguages)

// Test API endpoints directly
fetch('/api/patient-booking/available-languages').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check current language data
SELECT first_name, last_name, languages_spoken 
FROM providers 
WHERE is_active = true AND is_bookable = true;

-- Verify sample data population
SELECT COUNT(*) as providers_with_languages
FROM providers 
WHERE languages_spoken IS NOT NULL AND languages_spoken != '[]';
```

### Server Logs to Monitor
```
üìß Processing custom language request: {language: "Italian", ...}
‚úÖ Custom language request email sent successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to send email, but logging request: [details]
üîç Getting merged availability for payer X with language: Spanish
