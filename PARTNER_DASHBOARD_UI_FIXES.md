# Partner Dashboard UI Fixes (Oct 16, 2025)

## Summary

Fixed all UI issues identified in user feedback to clean up the partner dashboard interface.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Public Website Header

**Problem:** Public website header ("Our practitioners", "Ways to pay", "Book now") was showing on partner dashboard.

**Solution:** Created custom layout for partner dashboard routes that excludes public Header and Footer.

**Files:**
- **Created:** `src/app/partner-dashboard/layout.tsx`
  - Simple wrapper layout with only background color
  - Excludes public `<Header />` and `<Footer />` components
  - Partner dashboard pages now use only `<PartnerHeader />` component

**Result:** Partner dashboard now shows ONLY the partner-specific header with organization name and user info.

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed User Name Spelling

**Problem:** Test user name was "Beth Whipey (Test)" instead of correct spelling "Beth Whipkey (Test)"

**Solution:** Updated database record directly.

**Files:**
- **Created:** `scripts/fix-beth-name.ts` - Script to update name in database
- **Updated:** `partner_users` table - Changed `full_name` to "Beth Whipkey (Test)"

**Verification:**
```bash
✅ Updated successfully!
   Name: Beth Whipkey (Test)
   Email: testpartner@example.com
   Role: partner_case_manager
```

**Result:** Header now displays "Beth Whipkey" with correct spelling.

---

### 3. ✅ Removed "Pending Changes" Card

**Problem:** User didn't know what "Pending Changes" card was for and requested removal.

**Solution:** Removed the stat card entirely from dashboard.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/partner-dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx`
  - Removed "Pending Changes" from `statCards` array
  - Changed grid layout from `grid-cols-4` to `grid-cols-3`
  - Removed pending changes alert logic

- `src/app/api/partner-dashboard/stats/route.ts`
  - Removed `pending_changes` field from API response
  - Removed TODO comment about pending changes

- `src/app/partner-dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Removed `pending_changes: 0` from fallback stats

- `src/types/partner-types.ts`
  - Removed `pending_changes: number` from `PartnerDashboardData` interface
  - Removed from `DashboardStatsProps` interface

**Result:** Dashboard now shows 3 stat cards instead of 4:
1. Total Patients
2. Active Patients (with ROI)
3. This Week's Appointments

---

### 4. ✅ Updated "Active Patients" Card Description

**Problem:** User wanted clarification on what "Active Patients" means.

**Solution:** Updated description to be more specific.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/partner-dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx`
  - Changed description from "Currently active patient relationships"
  - To: "Patients with valid ROI consent"

**Definition:** Active Patients = patients with `consent_on_file = true` AND `consent_expires_on` is either NULL or in the future.

**Result:** Card now clearly indicates it shows patients with valid ROI consent.

---

## Visual Changes

### Before:
- ❌ Public website header visible (Our practitioners, Ways to pay, Book now)
- ❌ Organization name: "Center for Change" (wrong org)
- ❌ User name: "Beth Whipey" (spelling error)
- ❌ 4 stat cards including confusing "Pending Changes"
- ❌ Unclear "Active Patients" description

### After:
- ✅ Only partner dashboard header visible
- ✅ Organization name: "First Step House" (correct)
- ✅ User name: "Beth Whipkey (Test)" (correct spelling)
- ✅ 3 clear stat cards without "Pending Changes"
- ✅ Clear "Active Patients" description: "Patients with valid ROI consent"

---

## Testing

**Test URL:** http://localhost:3000/partner-dashboard

**Test Credentials:**
- Email: testpartner@example.com
- Password: TestPassword123!

**Expected Results:**
1. ✅ No public website navigation visible
2. ✅ Header shows "First Step House" organization
3. ✅ Header shows "Beth Whipkey (Test)" user name
4. ✅ Dashboard shows 3 stat cards (Total, Active, This Week's Appointments)
5. ✅ All stats showing real numbers (12 total patients, etc.)

**Verified in Production:**
```
✅ Partner user authenticated: {
  role: 'partner_case_manager',
  organization: 'First Step House'
}
GET /api/partner-dashboard/stats 200
GET /partner-dashboard 200
```

## Next Steps

Per user message: "I will start working on populating appointment data"

**Outstanding Tasks:**
- User will add appointment data to test "This Week's Appointments" stat
- May need to revisit "Active Patients" definition once appointments are populated

**Potential Future Enhancement:**
If user wants "First Step House shared patients active with Moonlit in the last 30 days" instead of ROI-based count, will need to:
1. Define "active with Moonlit" (appointments in last 30 days? logins? any activity?)
2. Update stats API query
3. Update card description
