## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Organization ID Query Issue
**Impact:** Low - Does not affect functionality
**Status:** Data query issue in test script only

**Details:**
- Test script has trouble reading nested organization data
- Live application works fine (verified in browser)
- Not a code issue, just test script limitation

**Workaround:** Organization data accessible via `/api/partner/me` endpoint

---

### 2. RLS Policies
**Status:** Not implemented in code (managed in Supabase)

**Current Approach:**
- All APIs use `supabaseAdmin` with manual `organization_id` filtering
- Security relies on API-level checks
- Works correctly, but no database-level RLS

**Recommendation:**
- For MVP: Keep current approach (faster, simpler)
- For production: Add RLS policies as documented in `PARTNER_DASHBOARD_RLS_REQUIREMENTS.md`

**See:** `PARTNER_DASHBOARD_RLS_REQUIREMENTS.md` for full RLS policy specifications
