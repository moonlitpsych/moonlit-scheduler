## Important: University of Utah Employees

University of Utah employees should know that their mental health benefits are managed by HMHI-BHN, NOT Regence or UUHP (even though their insurance card may say Regence or UUHP). Moonlit Psychiatry is fully credentialed with HMHI-BHN and accepts U of U employee insurance at in-network rates.

Many psychiatry practices in Utah accept "Regence" for medical care but are NOT credentialed with HMHI-BHN for behavioral health. This causes surprise bills for U of U employees. Moonlit does not have this problem.
